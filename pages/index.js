          <h2>About Us</h2>
          <p>
            Escape into a world-class manga and a fun anime lovers' community with Saiba Gang. We offer one of the richest stories in the metaverse and the premier manga on the blockchain.
          </p>
          <p>
            Solana is environmentally friendly and has negligible tranaction fees, making it the top choice for our community. It is also a top-five marketcap blockchain with incredible speed and performance. However, we believe the future is cross-chain!
          </p>
          <p>
            Join our community to participate in the storytelling and world-building and earn rewards (incuding NFTs!) for participating in the community! You can also tell your own Saiba's story and get paid to publish it on our website! We believe in the importance of community and in making crypto accessible to all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together, with our community, Saiba Gang is creating one of the most badass manga out there.

            <p>
              Saiba Gang NFTs are held on the Solana blockchain. A huge benefit
              to that is that it is extremely user friendly to get started
              getting your first Solana NFT compared to other ecosystems!
            </p>
            <p>
              Your first step is to get a wallet. “Wallets” let a user hold
              cryptocurrency and NFTs. In the Solana ecosystem, the preferred
              wallet is the Phantom wallet. To create your first wallet, visit{" "}
              <a
                className="content-link"
                rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank"
                href="https://phantom.app/"
              >
                https://phantom.app/
              </a>{" "}
              and follow the instructions to add the wallet to your browser.
              Help for that can be found at this link:{" "}
              <a
                className="content-link"
                rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank"
                href="https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406388623251-How-to-create-a-new-wallet"

                https://help.phantom.app/hc/en-us/articles/4406388623251-How-to-create-a-new-wallet
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Once you are finished creating your wallet, and you have all of
              your wallet details written down and stored in a secure location,
              you are ready to add some SOL to your wallet. The easiest way to
              do this is to send SOL from your preferred cryptocurrency
              exchange, like Coinbase, to the wallet address that you have just
              created. You can see a detailed guide here:{" "}
              <a
                className="content-link"
                rel="noreferrer"
                target="_blank"
                href="https://decentralizedcreator.com/deposit-solana-to-phantom-wallet/"
              >
                https://decentralizedcreator.com/deposit-solana-to-phantom-wallet/
              </a>
            </p>
            <p>
              Now that you&apos;ve added SOL to your wallet, you are ready to
              purchase some NFTs!
            </p>
